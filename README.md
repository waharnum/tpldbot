# tpldbot

## UPDATE JUN 02, 2017

Kept for legacy purposes, but the current version of https://twitter.com/tpldbot is now an Azure Function written in Node that I'll write something up about at some point.

A more poorly implemented imitation of [YUDLbot](https://github.com/yorkulibraries/YUDLbot).

Some [details of implementation are in this blog post](http://www.alanharnum.ca/libraries/hackathons/2015/11/18/joseph-bloorg.html).

Not officially associated with Toronto Public Library.

For "production", runs in a Docker container because DOCKER DOCKER DOCKER.
